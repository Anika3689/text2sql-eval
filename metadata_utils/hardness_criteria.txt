To effectively assess model performance across various query types, we categorize SQL queries 
into four distinct hardness levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extra Hard. 
These levels are determined by the presence and complexity of specific SQL components and conditions.

First, we define our criteria:

    SQL Components Set 1 (Basic Operations): WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, JOIN, OR, LIKE, HAVING
    
    SQL Components Set 2 (Complex Operations): EXCEPT, UNION, INTERSECT, NESTED (referring to nested queries or subqueries)
    
    Other Complexity Factors:
        - aggregation(AGG) function > 1
        - selected (SELECT) column > 1
        - where (WHERE) condition > 1
        - num of group by (GROUP BY) clauses > 1

We then define the hardness levels as follows:

1. EASY: 

    All of the following conditions must be met

    - It contains zero or exactly one keyword from SQL Components Set 1.

    - It satisfies none of the Other Complexity Factors.

    - It contains no keywords from SQL Components Set 2.

2. MEDIUM:

    If either of the following conditions is met:

        It satisfies no more than two of the Other Complexity Factors, AND

        It contains no more than one keyword from SQL Components Set 1, AND

        It contains no keywords from SQL Components Set 2.

        OR

        It contains exactly two keywords from SQL Components Set 1, AND

        It satisfies fewer than two of the Other Complexity Factors, AND

        It contains no keywords from SQL Components Set 2.

3. HARD:

    If any of the following conditions are met:

        It satisfies more than two of the Other Complexity Factors, AND

        It contains no more than two keywords from SQL Components Set 1, AND

        It contains no keywords from SQL Components Set 2.

        OR

        It contains more than two but no more than three keywords from SQL Components Set 1 (i.e., 3 keywords), AND

        It satisfies no more than two of the Other Complexity Factors, AND

        It contains no keywords from SQL Components Set 2.

        OR

        It contains no more than one keyword from SQL Components Set 1, AND

        It satisfies none of the Other Complexity Factors, AND

        It contains exactly one keyword from SQL Components Set 2
